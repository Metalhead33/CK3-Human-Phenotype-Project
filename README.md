# CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project

The CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project is intends to recreate all the phenotypes listed on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/) within the video game Crusader Kings 3.

The game is easily moddable and uses 3D portraits, making such a project relatively easy to implement, if not somewhat tedious *(due to the sheer number of existing human phenotypes)*.

## How can I *help/contribute*?

It depends on whether you play the game Crusader kings 3 or not.

* If you play Crusader Kings 3, and are familiar with the portrait editor, you can help by taking any of the phenotypes on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/), and recreating its morph images as a CK3 character via the portrait editor, copying the persistent DNA, then sending me the copied persistent DNA - or alternatively submitting a pull request.
* If you play Crusader Kings 3, but are generally clumsy with the portrait editor, you can help by giving moral support and showing interest, letting me know that the project isn't a wasted effort. Alternatively, you can  help by spreading the news.
* If you're well-versed in physical anthrophology, you can help by taking a look at any screenshots we send, and comparing them to the real-life phenotypes.

## Current status

Currently, we are at the stage of recreating various phenotype morphs in CK3 as characters with persistent DNA strings saved into this repository. After we are done with that, we are going to convert those persistent DNA strings into ethnicity templates, then we'll finally assign them to various cultures within the game.

So far, the following phenotypes were recreated:

✅ Veddid
✅ Turanid
✅ Tungid
✅ Sudanid
✅ South Mongolid
✅ Sinid
✅ Sibirid
✅ Orientalid
✅ Nordid
✅ Nilotid
✅ Mediterranid
✅ Lappid
✅ Indo Melanid
✅ Indid
✅ Ethiopid
✅ East Europid
✅ Dinarid
✅ Congolid
✅ Armenoid
✅ Alpinid
