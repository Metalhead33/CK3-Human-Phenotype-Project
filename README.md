# CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project

![Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Metalhead33/CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project/main/thumbnail.jpg)

The CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project is intends to recreate all the phenotypes listed on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/) within the video game Crusader Kings 3. [We have a Discord server](https://discord.gg/6SPk3Ss).

The game is easily moddable and uses 3D portraits, making such a project relatively easy to implement, if not somewhat tedious *(due to the sheer number of existing human phenotypes)*.

## How can I *help/contribute*?

It depends on whether you play the game Crusader kings 3 or not.

* If you play Crusader Kings 3, and are familiar with the portrait editor, you can help by taking any of the phenotypes on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/), and recreating its morph images as a CK3 character via the portrait editor, copying the persistent DNA, then sending me the copied persistent DNA [on the Discord server](https://discord.gg/6SPk3Ss) - or alternatively submitting a pull request.
* If you play Crusader Kings 3, but are generally clumsy with the portrait editor, you can help by giving moral support and showing interest, letting me know that the project isn't a wasted effort. Alternatively, you can  help by spreading the news.
* If you're well-versed in physical anthrophology, you can help by taking a look at any screenshots we send, and comparing them to the real-life phenotypes.

## Current status

As of now, the vast majority of old-world phenotypes that are relevant to CK3's scope (north of Benin, west of Tibet) have been implemented, and are in the process of being assigned to cultures. As of now, the mod is <span style="color:#ff0000">**incompatible**</span> with [Far Eastern Cultures for CK3](https://git.touhou.fm/metalhead/paradox-mods/far-eastern-cultures-ck3) or any other mod that modifiers vanilla cultures, but a compatibility patch will be developed for the earlier ASAP, and for other mods on request.
