The CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project is intends to recreate all the phenotypes listed on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/) within the video game Crusader Kings 3. [We have a Discord server](https://discord.gg/BUFPauXcax).

The game is easily moddable and uses 3D portraits, making such a project relatively easy to implement, if not somewhat tedious *(due to the sheer number of existing human phenotypes)*.

The mod is incompatible with any mods that edit vanilla cultures - [compatibility patches](https://git.sonck.nl/metalhead/paradox-mods/ck3-human-phenotype-project-compatibility-patches) must be developed, and will be developed on request.

Nevertheless, it is time for me to do that actual refining and re-make many - if not all - of the templates, which is going to take long as hell if I am to work solo, so... 

## <u>**FAQ:**</u>

### **Is this mod save-game compatible?**

Absolutely not. This mod edits ethnicities, which the game uses to randomly generate the looks/DNA of characters *(historical and new alike)*. Once the character was generated - or has scripted appearance - this mod will not modify them. For this mod to truly have effect, you need to start a new game, otherwise it will only affect newly generated characters.

### **Can I use your mod as part of my mod?**

**Yes.** You don't even need to ask. Just do it. Sure, crediting would be nice, but otherwise, feel free to.
