# CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project

The CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project is intends to recreate all the phenotypes listed on[http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/) within the video game Crusader Kings 3.

The game is easily moddable and uses 3D portraits, making such a project relatively easy to implement, if not somewhat tedious *(due to the sheer number of existing human phenotypes)*.
