# CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project

The CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project is intends to recreate all the phenotypes listed on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/) within the video game Crusader Kings 3.

The game is easily moddable and uses 3D portraits, making such a project relatively easy to implement, if not somewhat tedious *(due to the sheer number of existing human phenotypes)*.

## How can I *help/contribute*?

It depends on whether you play the game Crusader kings 3 or not.

* If you play Crusader Kings 3, and are familiar with the portrait editor, you can help by taking any of the phenotypes on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/), and recreating its morph images as a CK3 character via the portrait editor, copying the persistent DNA, then sending me the copied persistent DNA.
* If you play Crusader Kings 3, but are generally clumsy with the portrait editor, you can help by giving moral support and showing interest, letting me know that the project isn't a wasted effort. Alternatively, you can  help by spreading the news.
* If you're well-versed in physical anthrophology, you can help by taking a look at any screenshots we send, and comparing them to the real-life phenotypes.
