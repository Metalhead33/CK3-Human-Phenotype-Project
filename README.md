The CK3-Human-Phenotype-Project is intends to recreate all the phenotypes listed on [http://humanphenotypes.net/](http://humanphenotypes.net/) within the video game Crusader Kings 3. [We have a Discord server](https://discord.gg/BUFPauXcax).

The game is easily moddable and uses 3D portraits, making such a project relatively easy to implement, if not somewhat tedious *(due to the sheer number of existing human phenotypes)*.

The mod is incompatible with any mods that edit vanilla cultures - [compatibility patches](https://git.sonck.nl/metalhead/paradox-mods/ck3-human-phenotype-project-compatibility-patches) must be developed, and will be developed on request.

Nevertheless, it is time for me to do that actual refining and re-make many - if not all - of the templates, which is going to take long as hell if I am to work solo, so... 

## <u>**FAQ:**</u>

### **Is this mod save-game compatible?**

Absolutely not. This mod edits ethnicities, which the game uses to randomly generate the looks/DNA of characters *(historical and new alike)*. Once the character was generated - or has scripted appearance - this mod will not modify them. For this mod to truly have effect, you need to start a new game, otherwise it will only affect newly generated characters.


### **Will you put this mod to Steam Workshop? Why not?**

For legal reasons, I cannot do that. What legal reasons? Well, it's against the rules to disclose that, but here's a hint: I cannot upload any mods to the Steam Workshop at all. The less we talk about it, the better.

Nevertheless, if you wish to upload this mod to the Steam Workshop in my name, you have my full blessings to do so. No, really, you'd be doing me a big favor.

### **Can I use your mod as part of my mod?**

**Yes.** You don't even need to ask. Just do it. Sure, crediting would be nice, but otherwise, feel free to.
